You don't remember how you got here, the last thing you remember is sitting in front of your computer. Looking up at the tower makes you dizzy, it seems to extend infinitely into the sky. Looking down over the railing doesn't help either; the tower descends and disappears the clouds. There is a large stone door to the north that seems to lead inside. To its right is a pedestal with some type of book sitting on it. On the wall is a plaque.",
