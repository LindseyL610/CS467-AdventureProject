{"type": "Room", "data": {"id": "roomH", "name": "Web Room", "long_description": "You step into the west side of an extravagent marble hall, warmly lit by the glow from a fireplace in the north-east corner of the hall. A comfortable-looking velvet couch and two overstuffed chairs sit in front of the fireplace, making this room seem like a place where people gather together. There are some cobwebs in the corners of the room. What really draws your attention is the giant moth hovering directly across from you, on the east side of the room. You take a good look at the moth and notice that it is holding something in its mouth, though you can't tell what. Behind the moth lies a door, which the moth appears to be guarding. On the north side of the hall, you see a ramp going downward. On the south side of the hall, you see a pitch black opening. On the wall is a clock.", "short_description": "You are in the marble hall that looks to be a place where people gather together.", "exits": {"south": "<T:websOpening>", "north": "<T:websRamp>", "down": "<T:websRamp>", "west": "<T:websStairs>", "up": "<T:websStairs>", "east": "<T:webDoor>"}, "has_been_visited": false, "contents": ["<T:universalClock>", "<T:moth>", "<T:webCouch>", "<T:webChairs>", "<T:webFireplace>", "<T:webCobwebs>"], "msg_cannot_go_direction": "You cannot go that direction.", "msg_nothing_happens": "Nothing happens.", "documentation": "If you're having trouble, try debugging.", "msg_already_pro": "You are already feeling the effects of the pro function.", "msg_pro": "Your speed and coordination increase!", "msg_dance": "You dance.
