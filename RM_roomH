A comfortable-looking velvet couch sits in front of the fireplace, but what really draws your attention is the giant moth hovering directly across from you, on the east side of the room. You take a good look at the moth and notice that it is holding some sort of a cartride in its mouth. Behind the moth lies a door, which the moth appears to be guarding. On the north side of the hall, you see a ramp going downward. On the south side of the hall, you see a pitch black opening.", "short_description": "You are in the marble hall.", "exits": {"south": "<T:websOpening>", "north": "<T:websRamp>", "down": "<T:websRamp>", "west": "<T:websStairs>", "up": "<T:websStairs>", "east": "<T:webDoor>"}, "has_been_visited": false, "contents": ["<T:universalClock>", "<T:moth>"], "msg_cannot_go_direction": "You cannot go that direction.", "msg_nothing_happens": "Nothing happens.", "documentation": "If you're having trouble, try debugging.", "msg_already_pro": "You are already feeling the effects of the pro function.", "msg_pro": "Your speed and coordination increase!", "msg_dance": "You dance.
